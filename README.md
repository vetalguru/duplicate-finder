# Duplicate Finder

A **command-line tool** to efficiently find and delete duplicate files in a given folder.
Supports **interactive deletion**, exclusion patterns, and multi-threaded hashing for fast processing.

## üöÄ Features

- **Fast duplicate detection** using file size and SHA256 hashing
- **Interactive mode** for manual file selection
- **Dry-run mode** to preview deletions without modifying files
- **Exclusion patterns** to ignore specific files or folders
- **Multi-threaded hashing** for improved performance

## üîß Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vetalguru/duplicate-finder.git
cd duplicate-finder
```

Run without installation:

```bash
python -m duplicate_finder --help
```

Or install as a package:

```bash
pip install .
```

## üìå Usage

### Basic duplicate search:

```bash
python -m duplicate_finder "C:/Users/John/Documents"
```

### Interactive deletion:

```bash
python -m duplicate_finder "C:/Users/John/Documents" --interactive
```

### Automatic deletion (with confirmation):

```bash
python -m duplicate_finder "C:/Users/John/Documents" --delete
```

### Save deleted file paths to a report:

```bash
python -m duplicate_finder "C:/Users/John/Documents" --delete --delete-report deleted.txt
```

### Dry-run mode (preview deletions):

```bash
python -m duplicate_finder "C:/Users/John/Documents" --delete --dry-run
```

### Save results to a file:

```bash
python -m duplicate_finder "C:/Users/John/Documents" --output duplicates.txt
```

### Include only specific file types:

```bash
python -m duplicate_finder "C:/Users/John/Documents" --include "*.txt" "*.md"
```
### Exclude specific files or folders:

```bash
python -m duplicate_finder "C:/Users/John/Documents" --exclude "*.log" "temp/*"
```

### Skip small files (e.g., less than 100KB) and large ones (e.g., more than 100MB):

```bash
python -m duplicate_finder "C:/Users/John/Documents" --min-size 100K --max-size 100M
```
