# Duplicate Finder

A **command-line tool** to efficiently find and delete duplicate files in a given folder.
Supports **interactive deletion**, exclusion patterns, and multi-threaded hashing for fast processing.

## üöÄ Features

- **Fast duplicate detection** using file size and SHA256 hashing
- **Interactive mode** for manual file selection
- **Dry-run mode** to preview deletions without modifying files
- **Exclusion patterns** to ignore specific files or folders
- **Multi-threaded hashing** for improved performance

## üîß Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vetalguru/duplicate-finder.git
cd duplicate-finder
```

Run without installation:

```bash
python -m duplicate_finder --help

python -m duplicate_finder "C:/Users/John/Documents" --interactive
```

### Automatic deletion (with confirmation):

```

### Dry-run mode (preview deletions):

```bash
python -m duplicate_finder "C:/Users/John/Documents" --delete --dry-run
```

### Save results to a file:

```bash
